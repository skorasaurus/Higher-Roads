The readme file. 

This is an exercise to become familiar with migurski's high-roads. 

What's unique to this, compared to his high-roads, is that I intend to have more than just '3' levels, in fact, I plan to have about 7 or so, based on Openstreetmap's taxonomy 
[in the USA], so there'll be:

motorway
Primary 
secondary 
tertiary 
residential/unclassified 
service 



Right now, this is in its infancy stages
